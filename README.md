# L-systems-and-computer-graphics
Lindenmayer systems (L-systems) were introduced by Aristid Lindenmayer in 1968 as a mathematical formalism to describe biological growth processes, particularly in plants. Since then, L-systems have found applications in various domains, most notably in computer graphics and procedural generation. By leveraging formal grammars, L-systems allow for the recursive and parallel generation of structures, making them a powerful tool for modeling natural forms.

This project explores the connection between L-systems and the Chomsky hierarchy, which classifies formal languages based on their generative power. By analyzing the properties of L-systems and comparing them to Chomsky’s language classes, this work aims to determine how L-systems fit within this theoretical framework. Furthermore, practical implementations showcase how L-systems can be used for plant modeling in computer graphics, leveraging the turtle interpretation method to visualize generated structures.

# Abstract
This work investigates the relationship between Lindenmayer systems (L-systems) and the Chomsky hierarchy, as well as their applications in computer graphics. The Chomsky hierarchy provides a classification scheme for formal languages, while L-systems serve as a model for describing biological growth processes. This study first presents the theoretical foundations of both concepts and attempts to categorize L-systems within the Chomsky hierarchy by comparing their properties and production rules. Practical examples demonstrate how L-systems can be visualized using turtle graphics to generate plant structures.

The discussion highlights both the capabilities and limitations of L-systems in computer graphics. While L-systems utilize formal language principles, they do not fit neatly into Chomsky’s hierarchy due to their parallel application of rules and lack of terminal symbols. However, 0L-systems exhibit characteristics similar to Chomsky Type-2 languages (context-free grammars). Despite their constraints, L-systems provide a powerful tool for modeling plant growth and procedural structures, making them valuable for scientific and artistic applications. This work concludes that while L-systems share properties with formal grammars, their primary strength lies in their application to procedural modeling rather than strict adherence to linguistic classifications.
